Customer Retention Dashboard Project
Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard for the telecom industry's Retention Manager to effectively monitor and improve customer retention efforts. The project was initiated following the realization that retaining customers is paramount in the telecom sector, and there is a need to proactively identify and address customer attrition.

The Retention Manager expressed several key objectives for this project:

Customer Retention: The telecom industry values its customers highly and aims to reduce customer churn. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Proactive Approach: The current approach of reaching out to customers after contract termination is reactive. The project seeks to transition to a proactive strategy by identifying customers at risk of termination in advance.

Data-Driven Decision-Making: Previous customer analysis attempts in Excel were not fruitful. The dashboard will provide a visually intuitive and insightful representation of customer data to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Key Tasks:-
1. Define Proper KPIs
To ensure the dashboard effectively supports the Retention Manager's goals, it is crucial to define appropriate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reflect the key aspects of customer retention. These KPIs should include, but not be limited to:

Churn Rate: The percentage of customers who terminated their contracts in a given period.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): The predicted net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): A measure of customer satisfaction, often obtained through surveys.
Net Promoter Score (NPS): A metric gauging customer loyalty and willingness to recommend the telecom service.
Customer Engagement: Metrics related to customer interactions with the telecom service, such as call frequency, data usage, or support tickets.

2. Create a Dashboard
The primary deliverable of this project is the creation of a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard that reflects the defined KPIs. The dashboard should provide real-time or regularly updated insights into customer retention metrics. Key features of the dashboard include:

Interactive Visualizations: Utilize graphs, charts, and tables to display KPIs and trends.
Customer Segmentation: Group customers based on factors like usage patterns, demographics, or contract type.
Alerts and Notifications: Implement alerts for the Retention Manager to proactively address potential issues.
Predictive Analytics: Incorporate predictive models to identify customers at risk of churn.

Project Resources
To successfully complete this project, we will leverage the resources provided by the Retention Manager and engage with PwC's expertise to ensure the dashboard aligns with industry best practices.

This project will contribute significantly to the telecom industry's efforts to enhance customer retention, reduce churn, and ultimately increase profitability.
